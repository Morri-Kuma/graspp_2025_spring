EU organises firefighting teams and fleet of aircraft to support wildfire-hit countries
To prepare for the increased wildfire risk during the upcoming summer months, the EU has put together teams of firefighters and aircraft to help European countries affected by wildfires. To quickly support local fire brigades, throughout July and August, almost 650 firefighters from 14 European countries will be strategically positioned in key high-risk locations in France, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. They will boost the number of firefighters in each country. In addition, 22 firefighting airplanes and 4 helicopters will be stationed in 10 Member States to intervene in case of need. Coordinated and co-financed via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, these resources will help mitigate risks and enable a faster and more robust crisis response. These assets come on top of national capacities. This proactive approach confirms the EU's commitment to staying one step ahead of disasters, including those worsened by climate change, and to joining forces to protect lives, homes and the environment. European Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, is in Madrid today, where she meets with the Spanish civil protection authorities.
A press release is available online.

  Commission and national authorities urge SHEIN to respect EU consumer protection laws
Today, following a coordinated investigation at European level, the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network of national consumer authorities and the European Commission notified the online marketplace and e-retailer SHEIN of a number of practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. The CPC Network directed SHEIN to bring those practices in line with EU consumer laws. SHEIN remains under investigation and was requested to provide further information to the CPC Network.
The investigation covers a broad range of practices with which consumers are confronted while shopping on SHEIN and that are in breach of EU law, including for example fake discounts and pressure selling. In addition, the CPC Network requested information from SHEIN to assess its compliance with further obligations under EU consumer law. 
SHEIN now has one month to reply to the CPC Network's findings and propose commitments on how they will address the identified consumer law issues. Depending on SHEIN's reply, the CPC Network may enter a dialogue with the company. If SHEIN fails to address the concerns raised by the CPC Network, national authorities can take enforcement measures to ensure compliance. This includes the possibility to impose fines based on SHEIN's annual turnover in the EU Member States concerned.
More information is available in a press release online.

  European Labour Authority supports fair labour mobility in the EU 
The European Labour Authority (ELA) plays a pivotal role in fair labour mobility within the EU, according to the first Commission evaluation of ELA's five years of activity. With over 14 million EU citizens working and living in a Member State other than their own, ELA's support to fair mobility and social security coordination remains crucial.  
Between 2019 and 2023, ELA assisted Member States in 168 cross-border labour inspections, checking the situation of more than 13,500 workers in high-risk sectors like transport, construction and agriculture. 
The evaluation also identifies areas for improvement, including reinforcing the competences on concerted and joined inspections, or tackling situations regarding third country nationals within the EU, capacity in processing personal data, or simplifying and facilitating access to mediation procedure. 
Executive Vice-President for Social Rights and Skills, Quality Jobs and Preparedness, Roxana Mînzatu, said: “Mobile workers deserve equal treatment, fair working conditions and proper social protection. I welcome this Commission evaluation, which shows ELA's added value in supporting fair intra-EU labour mobility and ensuring respect for EU rules. This evaluation clearly points to the need to further strengthen the Authority including by reviewing its mandate. This is why, in early 2026, the Commission will come with a proposal to reinforce ELA, as part of a wider, Fair Labour Mobility package.”  
The European Labour Authority was established in July 2019 to ensure the fair, simple and effective enforcement of EU labour mobility rules and social security. The Commission must evaluate ELA's performance every five years, providing a critical assessment of the Agency's work and effectiveness. To support the evaluation, the Commission had conducted a public consultation in 2024. The evaluation is available online.

  The Commission approves a new geographical indication for Türkiye
The Commission has approved the addition of ‘Erzincan Tulum Peyniri' to the register of Protected Designations of Origin (PDO).
‘Erzincan Tulum Peyniri' is a cheese made from sheep's milk. It is matured in the sheep or goat's skin bag or plastic drums for at least 4 months. The cheese has an off-white colour, crumbly texture, and a rich, salty flavour.
‘Erzincan Tulum Peyniri' is produced in the province of Erzincan, in the East of Türkiye. Its characteristics are the result of traditional know-how and the specific natural conditions of the region, including the local flora and climate. Because of its unique geography, Erzincan province's climatic conditions have a positive influence on pasture and meadow, which eventually affect the milk composition and flavour of ‘Erzincan Tulum Peyniri'.
This new designation joins the more than 3,658 protected names already listed in the eAmbrosia database. More information is available on the Quality Policy pages.

May_20_2025,"Commission approves €1.2 billion Dutch State aid scheme to support industrial decarbonisation
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €1.2 billion Dutch scheme (‘NIKI') to support companies in their efforts to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (‘GHG') emissions. Lifecycle emissions are the overall emissions that are attributable to a product (or service) from raw material extraction and processing, to manufacturing of the product, transportation, and end-of-life management. The aid will be granted to those projects that overall provide the largest environmental benefit for the lowest cost to the taxpayer, looking at the entire product's lifecycle.
The NIKI scheme for the first time introduces competition between direct decarbonisation projects and resource efficiency and circularity projects in a State aid measure. Direct decarbonisation projects achieve emission reductions primarily by decarbonising the production processes, whereas resource efficiency and circularity projects achieve reductions primarily by using secondary or bio-based raw materials instead of primary or fossil-based raw materials. The scheme aims to contribute to the Netherlands' decarbonisation objectives, in line with the Political Guidelines of the European Commission for 2024-2029, which also call for a more circular and resilient economy. 
The Dutch scheme
The NIKI scheme will be open to companies of all sizes active in the manufacturing sector, in waste management, and in remediation activities within the Netherlands. To be eligible, each project must be capable of realising lifecycle GHG emission reductions of at least 100,000 tonnes.
Supported projects will be selected and the aid amount will be established following an open and competitive bidding process, based on the lowest aid amount requested per tonne of CO2 equivalent abated. The scheme is technology neutral.
During the five-year duration of the NIKI scheme, the Dutch government plans to organise one bid round (tender) per year.
The Commission's assessment
The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (‘TFEU'), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy 2022 (‘CEEAG').
This is the first State aid scheme bringing together projects under Sections 4.1 and 4.4 of the CEEAG, selected under a joint competitive bidding process. Section 4.1 covers aid for the reduction and removal of GHGs. Section 4.4 covers aid for resource efficiency and the transition to a circular economy.
The Commission found that:
The scheme is necessary and appropriate to support the industrial decarbonisation of the sectors covered by the scheme.
The scheme has an ‘incentive effect', as the beneficiaries would not carry out the relevant investments without the public support.
The Netherlands has put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure that the scheme has a limited impact on competition and trade within the EU.
In particular:
Beneficiaries will be selected following an open, transparent, and non-discriminatory bidding process;
Aid will be granted to companies implementing projects that achieve the highest CO2 equivalent abated per euro, which minimises public spending while incentivising climate-friendly investments;
The scheme has a claw-back mechanism through which unexpected profits exceeding the beneficiary's projected returns may be partly recovered by the Netherlands.
The aid will bring about positive effects, in particular on the environment, that outweigh possible negative effects in terms of distortions of competition.
On this basis, the Commission approved the Dutch scheme under EU State aid rules.
Background
The CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of aid measures for environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy, which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.103901 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.
Quote(s)
The NIKI scheme approved today will support projects that will significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of industrial production processes in the Netherlands. It will contribute to the EU’s objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050, while ensuring that any potential competition distortions are kept to the minimum.

Apr_11_2025,"Landmark agreement towards achieving net-zero emissions from global shipping by 2050
The European Commission welcomes today's agreement at the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), as a meaningful step towards achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from global shipping by 2050. This is a historic deal in the fight against climate change, marking a significant advancement in reducing the environmental impact of the shipping industry on a global scale. While today's agreement does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals, it constitutes a strong foundation for starting the required energy transition of shipping. The EU and its Member States played a key role in securing the deal and will remain actively engaged in the lead-up to its adoption in October 2025 and implementation in 2027.
In line with the 2023 IMO Strategy, the agreement includes a new measure, setting a global standard for gradually reducing the GHG intensity of marine fuels. It will regulate how “clean” the energy used by a ship should be, based on its climate impact. The measure applies to the full lifecycle of GHG emissions of shipping fuels. It uses standardised criteria and a common certification scheme for fuels that facilitates a level-playing field, irrespective where a fuel is produced, transported or used. As a result, it will prevent emissions from shifting to other sectors and encourage sustainable investments that will reduce emissions throughout the entire lifecycle across the globe. The EU looks forward to strengthening the measures over time to fully deliver on the decarbonisation pledges made in the 2023 IMO Strategy. 
The new measure also introduces a first global pricing mechanism for emissions, which along with financial incentives, will encourage shipping companies to use the cleanest fuels and technologies early on. For example, companies will be incentivised to invest in zero- and near-zero emission marine fuels, like renewable methanol and ammonia. By stimulating investment in these cleaner fuels, the measure will help reduce the shipping industry's GHG footprint.
The pricing mechanism will apply to a share of international shipping emissions from 2028, with an initial price of USD 100 per tonne of CO2. This will generate significant revenue, estimated to be USD 11-13 billion annually, which will be used to support the development and deployment of these zero- and near-zero emission fuels. Revenues generated from the measure will also be allocated to support a just and equitable transition, ensuring that no country is left behind. Those will be shared fairly, with particular attention given to least developed countries and small island developing states.
Next steps
The agreement will need to be confirmed by the International Maritime Organisation in October 2025. As the negotiations of the new agreement have concluded, it is time for all countries to start working on the implementation of the framework. The Commission will also assess the new global measure to see how it interacts with current EU maritime related regulations, maintaining environmental integrity while avoiding significant double burden. 
Background
The IMO's 2023 strategy sets out a clear roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping, with targets to reduce emissions by at least 20% (striving for 30%) by 2030, at least 70% (striving for 80%) by 2040, both in comparison to 2008 levels; and to achieve net-zero emissions by or around 2050.
This agreement is a major step towards achieving the Strategy's targets and demonstrates the commitment of the international maritime community to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting its sustainable development.
Quote(s)
Today’s landmark deal highlights the strong commitment of the international maritime community to reducing the sector’s carbon footprint while ensuring a just transition and a level playing field. In line with the EU’s net-zero ambitions, this agreement paves the way for long-term investments across the entire maritime fuel value chain, strengthening the industry’s sustainability and competitiveness for years to come. The Commission will remain actively engaged to ensure its adoption and effective implementation.
Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism
This agreement is a significant milestone, not just for shipping decarbonisation, but for global climate action as a whole. The agreement represents a key step towards achieving net-zero emissions in the maritime sector. This global achievement is even more remarkable and encouraging in the current geopolitical context. It shows that multilateralism remains the way to go. The Commission will continue to engage to increase IMO measures’ ambition over time.

Feb_26_2025,"Questions and answers on the Clean Industrial Deal
Why do we need the Clean Industrial Deal?
The EU must urgently address three challenges at once: the climate change, competitiveness and dependency on critical raw materials.
Decarbonisation is crucial to address these challenges. As the Draghi Report highlights, decarbonisation policies are a powerful driver of growth when they are well integrated with industrial, competition, economic and trade policies. This is why Europe needs a transformational business plan bringing together climate, circularity and competitiveness under one overarching growth strategy.
Competitive manufacturers drive innovation, quality-job creation and open strategic autonomy, but businesses need to be certain that large climate neutral investments in energy intensive industries and clean tech will be profitable. This is why the Clean Industrial Deal aims at creating the right conditions for the industry to invest and produce in the EU, namely by driving down energy prices and boosting demand for clean products. 
What is the Clean Industrial Deal, and what does it aim to achieve?
The Clean Industrial Deal is a business plan that makes decarbonisation achievable and profitable for industry in Europe. It commits to accelerate decarbonisation, promote the circular economy and support re-industrialisation, as sources of growth and prosperity across the entire continent. The Deal offers companies long-term predictability on our climate ambition, so that they can invest and minimise investment risks.
The Deal focuses mainly on two interlinked sectors:
Energy-intensive industries as they require urgent support to face high energy costs, unfair global competition and complex regulations.
Clean-tech as this sector will drive industrial transformation, competitiveness and decarbonisation. The Deal aims at boosting demand and uptake of clean products and solutions in the EU.
The Deal makes circularity a priority. It is key to make the best possible use of the EU's limited resources, reduce dependencies on scarce materials and enhance resilience. It reduces waste, production costs, and CO2 emissions while creating a more sustainable and competitive industrial model that benefits the environment.
Is the Clean Industrial Deal lowering the ambitions of the Green Deal?
Europe has set the ambitious target to become a decarbonised economy by 2050. It will stay the course on the objectives of the European Green Deal, with the achievement of the 55% net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction agreed for 2030, and through an intermediate 2040 target of 90%.
Especially in an unstable world, the EU's regulatory certainty and predictability, in combination with simplified rules, is a great asset to attract investments. The actions we have taken so far are already yielding results: we are decarbonising rapidly, reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels and tackling pollution of the environment. This Deal positions decarbonisation as a powerful driver of growth and prosperity for Europeans.
How will the Clean Industrial Deal help the EU industry?
The Clean Industrial Deal supports industry to growth and prosper, looking at the entire value chain. It focuses on:
Making energy more affordable as this is a key condition for the competitiveness of our industry.
Facilitating supply and creating demand for clean products and materials as companies need a market to make investments.
Making financial resources available to invest in decarbonisation and competitiveness to support industry as well as leveraging private investments. Without financial support, there will not be investments.
Securing access to raw materials and resources in the EU to reduce its exposure to unreliable suppliers. Putting circularity at the core of our strategy as the EU needs to secure resources, lower emissions and become more sustainable. 
Creating partnerships to get access to global markets, setting fair conditions for companies in the EU market. Protecting the industries again unfair global competition and overcapacities.
Building a workforce that fits the decarbonised industry, deliver quality jobs and promote social fairness.
What are the main legislative and regulatory initiatives?
The Clean Industrial Deal sets out several legislative and regulatory initiatives to support European industries, such as:
The Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act: it will speed-up permitting for industrial access to energy and industrial decarbonisation, such as the modernisation of steel production sites. It will also establish a low-carbon product label for steel and later cement, which will allow companies to reap the green premium and provide with information to consumers on carbon intensity of products. The Act also introduces resilience and sustainability criteria to foster clean European supply for energy-intensive sectors. These criteria (e.g. clean, resilient, circular, cybersecure) will strengthen demand for EU-made clean products.
The revision of the Public Procurement Directive: it will allow for sustainability, resilience and European preference criteria in EU public procurement for strategic sectors. These criteria will also be extended to incentivise private procurement, through measures such as life cycle-based CO2 emission performance standards.
The Circular Economy Act: it will shape a Single Market for waste and reusable materials. It will help making best use of the EU's limited resources, reduce dependencies on scarce materials coming from unreliable supplier and enhance resilience. It will lower production costs, reduce waste and CO2 emissions and create a more sustainable industrial model that benefits the environment while enhancing economic competitiveness.
A new Clean Industrial Deal State Aid Framework: it will allow for a quicker approval of State aid measures for the roll-out of renewable energy, deploy industrial decarbonisation and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity of clean tech decarbonization.
The delegated act on low carbon hydrogen: it will set out the conditions to produce low carbon in a pragmatic way. This completes our comprehensive regulatory framework on hydrogen, enhancing certainty and predictability for industry, which are key preconditions for companies to invest.
The strengthening and extension of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism: it will follow a thorough review on the need to extend it to other ETS sectors and downstream products as well on the problems faced by exporters of CBAM goods. As a first but necessary step we are also today simplifying CBAM.
How will the Clean Industrial Deal speed-up permitting?
Wind projects can last up to 7-10 years, distribution grid projects up to 8-10 years and transmission grid projects up to 17 years for. However, only 7 Member States use the more flexible permitting rules of the Renewable Energy Directive. The Commission calls on Member States to urgently use these new rules. The Commission will reinforce its support to Member States by sharing best practices and recommendations and launching an implementation dialogue on energy permitting.
The upcoming Industrial Decarbonisation Accelerator Act will propose concrete measures to address permitting bottlenecks related to industrial access to energy and industrial decarbonisation, while maintaining environmental safeguards and protecting human health. Shorter deadlines for energy infrastructure will also lower energy costs.
How will the Clean Industrial Deal help secure critical raw materials for the EU industry?
It is important to ensure that the EU industry has better access to critical raw materials as they are essential for our industry to the clean and digital transitions. To do so, the Commission will prioritise the implementation of the Critical Raw Materials Act and identify a first list of Strategic Projects in March 2025 to increase EU capacity to extract, process and recycle strategic raw materials and diversify EU supplies from third countries. The Commission also proposes the creation of an EU Critical Raw Material Centre to jointly purchase raw materials with increased market power and to coordinate strategic stockpiles.
Moreover, by placing circularity at the core of our decarbonisation strategy, including with the future Circular Economy Act, the EU not only makes essential materials more affordable and accessible, but also reduces our dependencies, as materials are recovered, reused, recycled, and kept longer in the economy. The Commission will make sure that products containing valuable and scarce materials are (re-)used efficiently and as long as possible before they become waste, including through the full roll out of Ecodesign requirements.
How will the Clean Industrial Deal ensure more investments? 
EU industry needs immediate access to capital. That is why the Clean Industrial Deal provides for (1) more EU-level funding, (2) leverage private investments and (3) enhance the effectiveness of State aid in support to the Deal objectives.
To provide short-term relief the Clean Industrial Deal will mobilise over €100 billion for EU-made clean manufacturing, including an additional €1 billion guarantees under the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In the next EU budget, the Competitiveness Fund plans to establish an investment capacity for European projects with the most EU added value along the entire investment journey - from research and innovation, through scale-up, industrial deployment, to manufacturing, including clean tech and industrial decarbonisation.
The Commission will propose an Industrial Decarbonisation Bank, aiming for €100 billion in funding, based on available funds in the Innovation Fund, additional revenues resulting from parts of the ETS as well as the revision of InvestEU. 
Prior to the revision of the ETS Directive in 2026, the Commission will launch in 2025 a pilot with a €1 billion auction on the decarbonisation of key industrial processes across various sectors supporting industrial decarbonisation and electrification, using a combination of existing resources under the Innovation Fund and auctions-as-a-service.
Public funding will also come from national tax incentives for which the Commission will issue recommendations on common guidelines.
In addition, a flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. €600 million will be launched under the 2026-2027 work programme to support fit-for-deployment projects.
Public funds, however, will not suffice. The Commission will soon propose a European Savings and Investments Union, including banking and capital markets. This will help leverage the enormous wealth of private savings in Europe to invest in innovation and the clean and digital transitions.
How will State aid support the objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal?
As part of the Clean Industrial Deal, the Commission will adopt a new Clean Industrial Deal State aid framework by June 2025 to accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy, deploy industrial decarbonisation and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity of clean tech. A survey conducted by the Commission showed that the Member States need more flexibility to support decarbonisation.
The new Framework will make it easier for Member States to give aid, by simplifying State aid rules while preserving a level playing field.
The Commission will also reflect on a further simplification of the State aid rules to prioritise work on the most distortive aid measures and accelerate authorisations of compatible aid. This includes the speeding up of proposals for new Important Projects of Common European Interest, and a revision of the General Block Exemption Regulation by 2027.

Commission disburses first €3 billion to Ukraine of its part of the G7 loan, to be repaid with proceeds from immobilised Russian assets
The European Commission has disbursed today the first €3 billion tranche of its exceptional Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) loan for Ukraine, which will be repaid with proceeds from immobilised Russian State assets in the EU. This loan, amounting up to €18.1 billion, represents the EU's contribution to the G7-led Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) loans initiative, which collectively aims to provide approximately €45 billion in financial support to Ukraine. This initial disbursement highlights the EU's unwavering commitment to helping Ukraine confront Russia's full-scale war of aggression, maintain macroeconomic and fiscal stability, rebuild vital infrastructure, including its energy systems, and invest in defence infrastructure. 
This MFA is crucial for addressing Ukraine's urgent budgetary needs, which have considerably risen in the face of Russia's intensified and prolonged war of aggression. With the stable, regular, and predictable financial support of up to €18.1 billion for 2025 under this instrument, Ukraine will be able to support its current and future military, budget and reconstruction needs. This loan will be able to ensure macroeconomic stability and restore critical infrastructure destroyed by Russia, such as energy infrastructure, water systems, transport networks, roads and bridges. Furthermore, the loan can be used by Ukraine to directly support its military expenses. At the same time, by stabilising public finances, this assistance will also enable Ukraine to allocate resources to other priority expenditures, including military defence infrastructure against Russian aggression.
Since the beginning of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, the EU, together with its Member States, has unequivocally condemned Russia's actions and has offered unprecedented support to Ukraine and its people. With this MFA disbursement, the EU, its Member States and European Financial Institutions have together provided nearly €134 billion, supporting the Ukrainian war effort and its economy, helping maintain basic services and offer early reconstruction, humanitarian assistance and help to those fleeing the war in the EU.
The press release is available online.

  Les nouvelles règles de l'UE en matière d'évaluation des technologies de la santé ouvrent une nouvelle ère à l'accès des patients à l'innovation
Le dimanche 12 janvier, le règlement sur l'évaluation des technologies de la santé (ETS) deviendra applicable, ce qui permettra d'améliorer sensiblement la disponibilité de technologies de la santé innovantes et efficaces pour les patients dans l'ensemble de l'UE.
Les nouvelles règles créent un cadre de l'UE pour l'évaluation des technologies de la santé, telles que les médicaments et les dispositifs médicaux, en favorisant la collaboration et la coordination entre les États membres de l'UE. Cela aidera les autorités nationales à prendre en temps utile des décisions plus éclairées sur la fixation des prix et le remboursement des technologies de la santé et à rationaliser la procédure pour les développeurs de technologies de la santé. Cela contribuera à un accès plus rapide et plus large à des nouveaux produits innovants et plus efficaces pour les patients.
Dans un premier temps, à partir du 12 janvier, ces nouvelles règles s'appliqueront aux demandes d'autorisation de mise sur le marché d'un nouveau médicament anticancéreux ou d'un médicament de thérapie innovante (ATMP). Les règles seront étendues aux médicaments orphelins en janvier 2028 et couvriront tous les nouveaux médicaments à partir de 2030. Certains dispositifs médicaux à haut risque seront également évalués à partir de 2026.
L'évaluation des technologies de la santé est un processus scientifique fondé sur des données probantes qui vise à éclairer la création de politiques de santé sûres et efficaces en résumant les informations sur les questions médicales, sociales, économiques et éthiques liées à l'utilisation d'une technologie de la santé. La Commission européenne a adopté sa proposition de règlement sur l'évaluation des technologies de la santé le 31 janvier 2018.

  Copernicus Global Climate Report 2024 confirms last year as the warmest on record, first ever above 1.5°C annual average temperature
The Copernicus Global Climate Highlights Report 2024, published today, confirms 2024 as the warmest year on record and the first to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels for the annual global average temperature. Last year was also the warmest for all continental regions, including Europe, except Antarctica and Australasia.
As also highlighted in the 2023 European State of the Climate Report and the European Climate Risk Assessment, the European continent has been warming twice as fast as the global average since the 1980s, becoming the fastest-warming continent on Earth. European land in the Arctic remains the fastest-warming region on Earth, and changes in atmospheric circulation are favouring more frequent summer heatwaves. Likewise, glaciers are melting and there are changes in the pattern of precipitation.
The overall frequency and severity of extreme weather events are increasing.  Sea surface temperatures remained exceptionally high, with July to December 2024, being the second warmest on record for the time of year, after 2023.
The EU is committed to supporting global climate action and becoming climate-neutral by 2050. It has agreed on targets and legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and the Commission has already recommended a 90% net GHG emissions reduction target for 2040.  The Commission published a Communication in April 2024 on how to effectively prepare the EU for climate risks and build greater climate resilience.   
Copernicus, Europe's eyes on Earth, is the Earth observation component of the European Union's Space programme. Funded by the EU, Copernicus is a unique instrument that looks at our planet and its environment to benefit all European citizens.

Dec_19_2024,"Joint press release: Commission and European Investment Bank clear an additional €2.7 billion from emissions trading revenues for cleaner energy systems via the Modernisation Fund
Following an assessment by the European Investment Bank under the Modernisation Fund, the European Commission has today disbursed €2.7 billion to support 39 investment projects in eight beneficiary Member States. This includes the very first investment confirmed in Slovenia under the Fund, a Member State which became beneficiary in 2024. These projects will help lower-income EU countries to strengthen their clean industrial sector and meet their 2030 climate and energy targets by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving energy efficiency. Funded by revenues from the EU's Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the Modernisation Fund has now provided €15.45 billion of investment to support projects in the clean energy transition since its launch in 2021.
The new support announced today complements the investments announced in June of almost €2.97 billion for other 38 projects, bringing the total disbursements from the Modernisation Fund in 2024 to €5.67 billion, covering 77 projects in 11 countries. This year alone, disbursements were made to Bulgaria (€65 million), Croatia (€52 million), Czechia (€1.283 billion), Estonia (€84 million), Hungary (€202 million), Latvia (€27 million), Lithuania (€185 million), Poland (€1.733 billion), Romania (€1.956 billion), Slovenia (€309 million) and Slovakia (€153 million).
The 77 projects supported this year focus on electricity generation from renewables, modernisation of energy networks, energy efficiency, and the replacement of coal generation with lower carbon intensity fuel. They include:
reinforcement of the electricity transmission grid to support renewables integration in Bulgaria;
production of electricity from photovoltaics and energy storage by water service providers in Croatia;
reduction of CO2 emissions during heat production in Czechia;
improved energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy use in public buildings in Estonia;
modernisation and development of renewable energy-based district heating systems in Hungary;
use of renewable energy sources in multi-apartment buildings, public buildings, and energy communities in Latvia;
modernisation of multi-apartment buildings in Lithuania, ensuring that renovated buildings achieve at least Energy Efficiency Class B and provide energy savings of no less than 40%;
development of electricity storage systems in Poland to improve the stability of the national electricity network;
installation of minimum 1 500 MWh of battery storage systems to existing renewable power plants in Romania;
increasing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in lower-income households in Slovakia;
investments in renewable electricity generation and energy storage capacities in Slovenia.
The deadline to submit investment proposals for potential Modernisation Fund support in the next disbursement cycle is 18 February 2025 for priority proposals and 21 January 2025 for non-priority proposals. Priority investments are those with a focus on modernising energy systems, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in energy, industry and transport, and improving energy efficiency listed in the EU ETS Directive. All other investments qualifying for the Modernisation Fund are considered as non-priority investments subject to additional scrutiny.
Background
The Modernisation Fund, funded by revenues from the auction of emission allowances from the EU ETS, now aims to support 13 EU countries in their transition to climate neutrality. Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia have benefitted from the Modernisation Fund since its launch in 2021.The revised EU ETS has broadened the scope of the Modernisation Fund, which can now provide financial support to three additional beneficiaries since 1st January 2024 – Greece, Portugal, and Slovenia.
The Modernisation Fund supports investments in the generation and use of energy from renewable sources, energy efficiency, energy storage, modernisation of energy networks, including district heating pipelines and grids, and just transition in carbon-dependent regions. 
The Fund complements other European instruments such as Cohesion policy and the Just Transition Fund. It mobilises significant resources, which can help eligible countries support investments in line with the  REPowerEU Plan and the Fit For 55 package. It operates under the responsibility of its beneficiaries in close cooperation with the European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
The EIB's investment proposal assessment activities in the Modernisation Fund are ring-fenced from the standard EIB financing and technical assistance operations to avoid any potential conflict of interest in carrying out the activities mandated in accordance with the ETS Directive and the Commission Implementing Regulation.

Dec_18_2024,"EU introduces Flight Emissions Label for more informed and sustainable travelling
Today, the Commission adopted a Regulation putting in place a Flight Emissions Label (FEL), which offers a clear and trustworthy methodology for calculating flight emissions. Airlines operating flights within the EU or departing from the EU will be able to voluntarily join this label which will be fully operational as of July 2025. By the beginning of next summer, passengers will have the possibility to view and compare the estimated greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of their flights enabling them to make more informed purchasing decisions.
Currently, the lack of a common methodology and criteria for estimating flight emissions leads airlines and ticket sellers to report emission levels using disparate methodologies which are not necessarily comparable. The Flight Emissions Label aims to change this by setting out a reliable and harmonised methodology for estimating flight emissions, considering factors like aircraft type, average passenger numbers and freight volume on board, as well as aviation fuel used.
When searching for flights or booking tickets online, a dedicated logo will be displayed alongside the flight emissions data, guaranteeing that the information is reliable. This will help passengers make informed decisions and protect them from misleading greenwashing claims.
The Flight Emissions Label will support aviation's transition to net zero by ensuring fair competition among airlines, promoting the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), and supporting fleet renewal. Since the estimations are based on actual consumption data, it will also encourage airlines to operate more efficiently and sustainably.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will be responsible for estimating the flight emissions in accordance with the most advanced international standards on the accounting of aviation emissions. This methodology will allow for a fair, transparent, and harmonised estimation of flight emissions based on the most recent performance in the same route.
Next steps
By 1 February 2025, airlines that operate flights within the EU or depart from the EU can opt-in to participate in the Flight Emissions Label. To do so, they will need to submit the required data to the EASA. The first flight labels will then be assigned by EASA by 1 July 2025, and will apply to flights scheduled during the 2025 winter season.
Background
The Flight Emissions Label is foreseen by Article 14 of the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation. This Regulation is part of the EU's broader strategy to promote sustainable aviation, with a focus on increasing the use of SAF through various initiatives, including the ReFuelEU Aviation, the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and other measures. The goal is to ensure fair competition in the aviation industry while encouraging its transition towards more sustainable practices. Airlines from the EU and non-EU countries, eligible under ReFuelEU Aviation, may choose to participate in the Flight Emissions Label scheme on a voluntary basis. To maintain a level playing field, the scheme prohibits private initiatives from displaying EU flight emissions information to passengers, ensuring that all operators adhere to the same standards.
For more information
Flight Emissions Label – EASA website
 Quote(s)
The EU is taking another significant step toward cleaner and more competitive European aviation. The Flight Emissions Label will transform air travel by providing passengers with transparent and reliable information about flight emissions. It will put an end to misleading environmental claims about flight emissions and foster a level playing field, enabling fair competition and driving sustainability across the transport and tourism industries.

Dec_17_2024,"Commission approves €1.7 billion Danish State aid scheme to support the production of renewable gas
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, an estimated €1.7 billion (DKK 13 billion) Danish scheme to support the production of renewable gas to be injected into the grid. The scheme will contribute to the EU's climate targets in line with the European Green Deal, as well as the objectives of the REPowerEU Plan to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and accelerate the green transition.
The Danish scheme
Denmark notified the Commission of its plans to introduce a scheme, with an estimated budget of around €1.7 billion (DKK 13 billion), to support the production of upgraded biogas and e-methane to be injected into the Danish grid. The measure is expected to support the production of 7.9 petajoules of renewable gases per year.
The scheme will support the construction of new plants, as well as the extension of existing plants. The biogas plants must comply with the sustainability and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions saving criteria set out in the Renewable Energy Directive, while the e-methane plants must prove compliance with the criteria for the production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs) set out in the delegated acts on renewable hydrogen.
Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of a price premium per gigajoule of renewable gas produced, paid on top of the market price for natural gas, over a 20-year period. The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process where beneficiaries will bid on the price premium needed to carry out their project. Denmark plans to conduct five bidding rounds from 2024 until 2030. The plants must be connected to the grid within three years after the granting of the aid.
The scheme is expected to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 450,000 tonnes of CO2 annually from 2033. It will also contribute to Denmark's efforts to reduce its GHG emissions by 70% by 2030 compared to the 1990 levels and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
The Commission's assessment
The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107 (3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the 2022 Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (CEEAG).
The Commission found that:
The scheme is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the production of upgraded biogas and e-methane in line with the EU's objectives under the European Green Deal and the REPowerEU Plan.
The aid has an incentive effect, as the beneficiaries would not carry out the investments in renewable gas plants to the same extent without the public support.
Denmark has put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure that the scheme has a limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. In particular, the beneficiaries will be selected following an open, transparent and non-discriminatory bidding process and the aid will be kept to the minimum necessary to undertake the projects.
The aid brings about positive effects that outweigh any potential distortion of competition and trade in the EU.
On this basis, the Commission approved the Danish scheme under EU State aid rules.
Background
The  2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.
With the European Green Deal Communication in 2019, the Commission set an objective of net zero emissions of GHG in 2050 that is enshrined in the European Climate Law. In force since July 2021, the law also introduced the intermediate target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Through the adoption of the ‘Fit for 55' legislative proposals, the EU has in place legally binding climate targets covering all key sectors in the economy.
In May 2022, the Commission published the REPowerEU plan, which sets out a series of measures to rapidly reduce EU's dependence on Russian fossil fuels by accelerating the clean energy transition. The REPowerEU plan is based on three pillars: saving energy, producing clean energy and diversifying the EU's energy supplies.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.102206 in the State aid register on the Commission's competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.
Quote(s)
This €1.7 billion scheme will boost the production of renewable gas in Denmark. The measure will help Denmark meet its emission reduction targets and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. It will also contribute to the green transition, while limiting possible distortions of competition.

Dec_11_2024,"European Commission to issue €90 billion in long-term EU-Bonds in the first half of 2025
The Commission intends to issue up to €90 billion of EU Bonds in the first half of 2025 (H1), from January to June 2025. The Commission's funding plan for H1 2025 continues the 2024 issuance programme, during which the EU raised €138 billion in long-term funds.
Funds raised by the European Commission through EU-Bond issuances continue to drive the EU's recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, strengthen the resilience of its economy, and support the EU's neighbouring partners, notably Ukraine and the Western Balkans.
These wide-ranging borrowing operations will strengthen the EU Bond market while guaranteeing continuous support to policies funded through EU-Bond issuances. Besides long-term funding operations, the Commission will continue issuing short-term EU-Bills to complement its financial operations.
2024 marked the highest annual issuance volume ever executed by the EU, in line with the announced planning. Additionally, in 2024, the EU became the fifth largest issuer of green bonds globally with over €68 billion outstanding in NextGenerationEU (NGEU) Green Bonds, and is now on track to become the largest global green bond issuer.
The recently published NGEU Green Bond Impact and Allocation report confirmed the EU's role as a global leader in sustainable finance. As demonstrated in the report, the full implementation of green investments financed through NGEU Green Bonds could result in a reduction of 55 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the EU annually, equivalent to 1.5% of all GHG emissions.
For 2025 as whole, the Commission anticipates issuing approximately €160 billion in EU Bonds, ensuring consistent support for its borrowing-based programmes.
Background
On the basis of mandates under several borrowing programs, the Commission borrows funds on international capital markets on behalf of the EU and disburses them to Member States and third countries. Under the EU Treaties, all Member States are legally obligated to contribute to the EU budget, which guarantees EU borrowing.
Instead of issuing bonds for specific programs with separate labels, in 2023 the Commission began issuing EU-Bonds under a single brand (unified funding approach). The allocation of proceeds from these single-branded bonds is based on processes outlined in the applicable agreements for the relevant programs.
The outstanding stock of EU-Bonds now stands at over €580 billion, with more than €420 billion under the EU's unified funding approach. The successful execution of EU issuances has been greatly aided by the growing market acceptance of EU-Bonds as large, liquid, and high-quality assets. In October 2024, the EU took another significant step to support the market ecosystem for EU-Bonds and secondary market liquidity with the opening of the repurchase (repo) facility, which helps EU Primary Dealers post prices in EU-Bonds in support of their liquidity.
By early December 2024, a total of almost €330 billion of funds raised from borrowing operations have been disbursed under the NGEU programme. 2024 also saw borrowing operations financing Ukraine under the Ukraine Facility (over €10 billion of funds were disbursed until 2024), as well as the approval of an exceptional Macro-Financial assistance (MFA) loan by Member States within the agreement with G7 partners. Additionally, new policies funded via the issuance of EU-Bonds were agreed upon to support candidate States under the Western Balkan Investment Facility and neighbouring countries (such as Egypt and Jordan).
The EU has also continued issuing EU-Bills on a regular basis, with maturities of three and six months, complementing long-term borrowing activities.  The amount of short-term debt now stands at €25.3 billion.
While new net debt issuance for the largest borrowing-based programme – NGEU – will conclude by the end of 2026, the combination of refinancing maturing debt and bond-financing for other policies, will ensure a strong EU market presence in the foreseeable future. The Commission will also continue issuing NGEU Green Bonds, which currently total €68 billion, to fund the green component of the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

Nov_20_2024,"EU continues to be a global leader on sustainable finance
More than three years after the first transaction of our NextGenerationEU (NGEU) Green Bonds, the EU has issued more than €65 billion of NGEU Green Bonds, setting the EU on track to becoming the largest issuer of Green Bonds in the world.
In line with the announcement of President von der Leyen in her State of the Union address of 2020, the European Commission will continue to work towards issuing 30% of the NextGenerationEU financing through Green Bonds. NGEU Green Bonds are expected to enable €264.6 billion of green investments in the nine sectors set out in the NGEU Green Bond Framework, including  clean transport, clean energy and energy efficiency, confirming the EU's leading role in sustainable finance.
The full implementation in the coming years of all measures that can be funded by NGEU Green Bonds will provide a significant contribution to the EU's green transition, reducing GHG emissions by an estimated 55 million tons per year within the Union. This is 1.5% of all GHG emissions in the EU and equivalent to the combined emissions of 15 million EU households or to replacing 38 million of the EU's 250 million internal combustion cars with electric vehicles. These are the results of this year's comprehensive analysis of the expected climate impact of the NextGenerationEU Green Bonds allocation published today in an annual report.
Green Bonds are also an excellent opportunity for investors being part of the solution: tackling the challenges of our generation and contributing to an environment in which our children can live is the highest return on investment.
The Commission launched a dedicated Green Bond Dashboard in 2022 to provide full transparency about how the financing raised from NextGenerationEU green bonds is invested. It does so by providing a real-time overview of the measures and related expenditures that receive financing from the green bonds. This data will further reassure investors that the Commission is issuing green bonds in line with the highest standards and best market practices.
Overall, the EU's presence in the capital markets has increased tenfold in just 5 years. Today, the EU's total bonds outstanding have surpassed the half-trillion Euro mark.
In a volatile global environment, liquid and safe collateral EU bonds increase the pool for safe euro-denominated assets and offer an opportunity to diversify risks.
Next steps
The Commission will continue to provide reports on climate impacts of the NextGenerationEU Green Bonds allocation on an annual basis.
Background
Under the NGEU instrument at least 37% of spending in Member States' Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs) will be used for sustainable investments and reforms in areas such as green infrastructure and renewable energy. Member States are required to report to the Commission on the implementation of climate-relevant measures, enabling the Commission to issue NGEU Green Bonds to finance these investments. The report provides a detailed update on the expenditures to be financed through NGEU Green Bond issuance, and on the progress with their implementation.
NGEU Green Bond issuances are underpinned by the NGEU Green Bond framework. The framework, adopted in September 2021, is aligned with the Green Bond principles of the International Capital Market Association, ensuring alignment with market standards on the use, management and reporting of proceeds.
The annual NGEU Green Bonds Impact and Allocation report is the principal means for communicating with investors and stakeholders on the use of proceeds and the climate impacts of NGEU Green Bond financed investments. 
This edition of the report builds on previous NGEU Green Bonds Allocation and Impact Reports. The information included in the report is based on a cut-off date of 1 August 2024.

The report published today underlines the global leadership the EU has taken in green financing. The full roll-out of investments financed by NGEU Green Bonds is expected to reduce the EU's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55 million tonnes per year – equivalent to GHG emitted by 15 million EU households. NGEU Green Bonds provide a unique combination to investors – they are safe, sustainable, and successful!

Oct_31_2024,"EU greenhouse gas emissions fell by over 8% in 2023, driven by impressive growth in renewable energy
The European Commission has published today the 2024 Climate Action Progress Report, showing that net EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 8.3% in 2023 compared to the previous year. This is the largest annual drop in decades, with the exception of 2020 when COVID-19 led to emission cuts of 9.8%. Net GHG emissions are now 37% below 1990 levels, while GDP grew by 68% over the same period, showing the continued decoupling of emissions and economic growth. The EU remains on track to reach its commitment to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030.
Emissions from power and industrial installations covered by the EU Emissions Trading System saw a record 16.5% decrease in 2023. ETS sector emissions are now around 47.6% below 2005 levels and well on track to reach the 2030 target of -62%.
Under the EU ETS, emissions from electricity production and heating decreased by 24% compared to 2022, driven by the growth of renewable energy sources, in particular wind and solar energy, and the transition away from coal. Aviation emissions grew by 9.5%, continuing their post-COVID trend.
The EU ETS generated revenues of €43.6 billion in 2023 for climate action investments. €7.4 billion is assigned to the Innovation Fund and the Modernisation Fund, with the rest of the money going to Member States directly.
Buildings, agriculture, domestic transport, small industry and waste emissions (covered by the Effort Sharing Regulation) fell by around 2% in 2023. Reductions were driven by the buildings sector, decreasing by around 5.5%. Agricultural emissions fell by 2% while transport emissions fell by less than 1%.
The EU's natural carbon sink increased by 8.5% in 2023, reversing the declining trend of the past decade in the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. However, further efforts are needed to meet the 2030 targets.
While this report gives encouraging news on EU emission reductions, the last year has also seen more catastrophic events and lost lives and livelihoods, driven by our already changing climate, and global emissions have not yet peaked. Continued action is necessary to ensure that the EU meets its 2030 targets and sets itself on the right path to achieve its future 2040 target, and the 2050 goal of net zero emissions. The EU must also continue its international engagement, starting with COP29 next month, to ensure that our international partners are also taking the necessary action.
While Member States are slowly improving on climate adaptation and building resilience, further action is crucial. In 2023, Europe experienced its largest wildfires ever recorded, one of the wettest years on record, major marine heatwaves, widespread devastating flooding, and a continuing increase in temperatures. The Commission Communication on Managing Climate Risks and the European Climate Risk Assessment both stressed that climate exposure needs to be considered at all levels of governance when setting policy priorities, and across all sectoral policies.
The past year has seen productive engagement by the EU with its international partners to enhance climate action, most notably at COP28 in Dubai. At COP28, the Parties concluded the first Global Stocktake under the Paris Agreement, with decisions on accelerating action by 2030 and beyond, including the transition away from fossil fuels, tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030. The EU, its Member States and financial institutions, collectively known as Team Europe, remain the leading contributor of development assistance and the world's biggest climate finance contributor, accounting for about a third of global public climate finance.
Background
The Climate Action Progress Report complements the annual State of the Energy Union Report. It outlines the progress made towards the EU's emission reduction targets, as required by the Governance Regulation. The report also sets out key achievements and recent developments in the fight against climate change. It covers actual (historic) emissions and projected future emissions for every Member State, and information on EU policies and measures, climate finance and adaptation.

Quote(s)
The EU is leading the way in the clean transition, with another year of strong greenhouse gas emission reductions in 2023. The EU now represents 6% of global emissions. As we head off soon to COP29, we once again demonstrate to our international partners that it is possible to take climate action and invest in growing our economy at the same time. Sadly, the report also shows that our work must continue, at home and abroad, as we are seeing the harm that climate change is causing our citizens.

EU requests establishment of arbitration tribunal over the UK's prohibition of fishing of sandeel 
Today, the EU decided to request the establishment of an arbitration tribunal under the dispute settlement mechanism of the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) concerning the United Kingdom's decision to prohibit the fishing of sandeel. The arbitration tribunal would rule on the compatibility of the measure with the TCA.  
In effect since 26 March 2024, the prohibition of the fishing of sandeel in the English waters of the North Sea and in all Scottish waters prevents EU vessels from operating this sustainable fishery. The EU questions the compatibility of this prohibition with the TCA. For this reason, in April 2024, the EU requested consultations with the UK to find a mutually agreeable solution, formally initiating proceedings under the TCA dispute settlement mechanism. Consultations concluded without reaching such a mutually agreed solution, to which the EU remains open. The establishment of an arbitration tribunal constitutes the next step of the dispute settlement procedure. 
When it comes to managing shared resources, all decisions taken by the EU or the UK must be non-discriminatory, proportionate to the objectives and based on the best available scientific evidence. The EU and the UK set fishing opportunities for sandeel on the basis of state-of-the art independent advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which allows for harvesting fish stocks at levels that allows them to reproduce at their maximum capacity and maintaining healthy population levels. The EU is committed to promoting environmental, social and economic sustainability. It acts to protect and restore marine ecosystems for sustainable and resilient fisheries under the common fisheries policy and the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and in line with its commitments under the TCA. 
Further background to this issue is available in the April 2024 press release on the opening of consultations.

  La Commission propose 116 millions d'euros au titre du Fonds de solidarité de l'Union européenne afin d'aider l'Allemagne et l'Italie à se relever de catastrophes naturelles 
La Commission propose aujourd'hui une aide financière de 116 millions d'euros au titre du Fonds de solidarité de l'Union européenne (FSUE) pour aider l'Allemagne et l'Italie à faire face aux conséquences des graves inondations qui ont frappé ces pays en mai et juin 2024.   
Cette proposition de financement suit des demandes d'intervention du FSUE présentées par les pays concernés, qui ont soumis à la Commission des évaluations de dommages incluant l'estimation des dégâts subis. La proposition de financement de la Commission est donc basée sur ces évaluations et les seuils spécifiques fixés dans le règlement. Par conséquent, l'enveloppe d'aide serait la suivante : 112,07 millions d'euros pour l'Allemagne suite aux dommages causés par les inondations dans les États de Bavière et du Bade-Wurtemberg à la fin du mois de mai 2024 ; et 3,96 millions d'euros pour l'Italie afin de soutenir les efforts de redressement après les inondations qui ont frappé la région du Val d'Aoste en juin 2024.  
L'aide du FSUE couvrira une partie des coûts des opérations d'urgence et de redressement, y compris la réparation des infrastructures endommagées et la sécurisation des infrastructures préventives, la sauvegarde du patrimoine culturel, ainsi que les opérations de nettoyage.   
Elisa Ferreira, commissaire chargée de la cohésion et des réformes, a déclaré : « Le Fonds de solidarité de l'UE illustre concrètement la solidarité européenne en action, en donnant la priorité aux personnes et aux régions, et en les aidant à se relever de catastrophes naturelles dévastatrices. Il constitue un outil puissant pour aider nos communautés à se reconstruire, en apportant des secours lors d'une catastrophe, et en renforçant la résilience des États membres face aux futures catastrophes liées au climat. »  
Une fois la proposition de la Commission approuvée par le Parlement et le Conseil, l'aide financière pourra être versée en une seule fois. Les interventions d'urgence et de redressement peuvent être financées rétroactivement dès le premier jour de la catastrophe.   
Cette proposition fait suite à une autre proposition de financement présentée par la Commission en août 2024 visant à mobiliser plus d'un milliard d'euros pour aider l'Italie, la Slovénie, l'Autriche, la Grèce et la France à se remettre des récentes catastrophes naturelles. La proposition a été adoptée par le Parlement et le Conseil en octobre 2024. La Commission prépare actuellement les décisions de mise en œuvre correspondantes.

   Report highlights an increase in the Commission's engagement with national parliaments in 2023 
Today, the Commission adopted the 2023 annual report on relations with national parliaments and on the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles. This report highlights an increase in the participation of national parliaments in the political dialogue with the Commission, showcasing a total of 402 written opinions by parliaments to the Commission, a figure that stands over 10% more than that of 2022. It indicates that national parliaments continued to engage with the Commission on its political priorities, whilst paying particular attention to the European Green Deal, a new push for European democracy and promoting our European way of life. National parliaments also paid special attention to the 2023 Commission work programme, making it the most commented document, as well as the ongoing Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, reflections on the future of the Union, enlargement, migration and security. 
The number of reasoned opinions by national parliaments indicating perceived breaches of the subsidiarity principle in Commission proposals amounted to 22. This number represents almost a third fewer than the 32 received in 2022, a figure in line with a long-term downward trend in this respect.  
The report shows that Members of the College held 127 meetings with national parliaments. It explains the changes that several national parliaments have implemented to be earlier and better informed on the EU policy process, as well as how to express their views more effectively. Similarly, it points out that some national parliaments have started using the political dialogue in innovative ways. For example, one Chamber issued several opinions on the same proposal at different stages of the legislative process, and other Parliaments used joint opinions to collectively influence ongoing negotiations in their final phase. This illustrates the strategic potential and flexibility that the dialogue between the national parliaments and the Commission offers. 
The 2023 report and its previous editions are available online.

  Commission approves new geographical indication ‘Urbezo' wine from Spain  
The Commission has approved the addition of the wine product ‘Urbezo' from Spain to the register of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). 
‘Urbezo' is wine produced from grapes grown in the Ebro River basin in northern Spain. The wine is well-balanced with aromatic and fruity expression, good colour, very ripe tannins and characteristics that remain stable for a long time.  
Wine production is deeply linked to the area known as ‘Urbezo', with documented evidence of wine-growing since the early 19th century.  The peculiarities of the regional climate and soil, combined with the cultivation and production processes, make the wine unique and guarantee their quality. The production in the area is also geared towards making wine-growing more sustainable from the environmental, social and economic perspectives.   
This new denomination will be added to the list of 3,631 agricultural products already protected. The list of all protected geographical indications can be found in the eAmbrosia database. More information is available online at Quality Schemes and on our GIView portal.

  Commission approves €724 million Danish State aid greenhouse gas tax reduction scheme for companies at risk of carbon leakage 
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €724 million (DKK 5.4 billion) Danish scheme to lower the rate of a new greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions tax for certain companies. The measure aims to prevent the risk of carbon leakage, where companies relocate production outside of the EU to countries with less ambitious climate policies, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions globally. 
As part of a broader ‘Green Tax Reform' agreed in 2022, Denmark decided to introduce a tax on GHG emissions from activities covered by the EU Emissions Trading System Directive (‘CO2 emissions tax') in line with the goal of reducing Denmark's emissions by 70% in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The CO2 emissions tax is calculated based on the number of emission allowances that operators must surrender each year under the EU emission trading system (‘ETS1'). The tax aims to further encourage the reduction of CO2 emissions in Denmark, boosting the impact of ETS1 by providing operators with a stronger financial incentive to cut their CO2 emissions.  
Denmark notified the Commission of its plans to introduce an estimated €724 million (DKK 5.4 billion) scheme to lower the CO2 emissions tax rate for certain companies to mitigate the risk of carbon leakage.  
The measure will benefit companies that (i) are subject to ETS1, (ii) are active in sectors listed in the EU ETS Carbon Leakage List, and (iii) cause CO2 emissions through eligible production processes, namely mineralogical and metallurgical processes, chemical reduction and electrolysis. Eligible companies will benefit from a reduced tax rate which will be set at 33% of the standard rate. The scheme will run until 31 December 2033. 
Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: “This €724 million scheme enables Denmark to support those companies most at risk of carbon leakage in the context of its Green Tax Reform. The scheme maintains incentives for an effective decarbonisation of the Danish economy, in line with the European Green Deal objectives. At the same time, it keeps distortions of competition to the minimum.” 
A press release is available online.

  Commissioner Lenarčič at EU-funded civil protection exercise in Germany 
Today, Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič, is in Germany, to visit a full-scale civil protection exercise funded by the European Commission. The Magnitude exercise simulates a scenario of a devastating earthquake. Participants to the exercise include European response teams from Austria, Greece, France, Switzerland, as well as 12 German response teams, eight German authorities, and an EU civil protection team of six experts. Exercises, such as the Magnitude, are fundamental to better prepare response capacities from various European countries to improve their ability to work together in a real emergency, inside or outside Europe. 
The EU contributes nearly €1 million to the exercise, which covers 85% of its costs. The aim of the exercise is to improve capabilities of agencies, emergency services and the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) in coordination, preparedness and response to large-scale disasters. The exercise hosts an observers' programme for representatives from about 15 countries. The project includes one tabletop exercise that took place in Stuttgart on 15-16 October 2024, and the full-scale exercise in Mosbach, Mannheim and Schwarzach on 24-26 October 2024. This is the biggest and most international exercise in Germany under this programme since 2007, and it is the first time that Switzerland participates with response teams in a UCPM exercise. More information about other exercises across the EU and UCPM participating states is available. 
Janez Lenarčič, Commissioner for Crisis Management said: “I welcome the organisation of civil protection exercise by Baden Württemberg. It is the biggest and most international EU Civil Protection Mechanism full-scale exercise ever organised in Germany. With professionals from across Europe working together to improve our collective disaster preparedness. These efforts are more important than ever. As the climate crisis worsens, extreme weather events are now an almost annual occurrence across Europe and beyond. In response, we must increase our disaster preparedness on a local, national and a European level to keep pace with this ever-growing rate of disaster.”

Oct_23_2024,"Questions and answers on the results of the 2023 call for proposals under the Innovation Fund 
1. What projects are selected by the Innovation Fund's 2023 call? 
337 applications were received under the Innovation Fund 2023 call with total requests exceeding the initially earmarked €4 billion budget by over 6 times. 283 were eligible and admissible for evaluation and 85 innovative net-zero projects were finally selected in 18 countries to receive grants of €4.8 billion. The results also show that the geographical scope of the Fund is expanding to 26 European countries, with innovative projects selected in Estonia and Slovakia for the first time. 
These projects cover a wide range of sectors from the following categories: energy-intensive industries, renewable energy, energy storage, Industrial Carbon Management and net-zero mobility (dedicated provisions were included for maritime, aviation and road transport) and buildings. All selected projects in this call are set to enter into operation before 2030 and have the combined potential to avoid 476 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions in their first 10 years of operation (based on the projects's greenhouse gas calculations).   
The call supports projects in five different topics: general decarbonisation for large-scale, medium-scale, and small-scale projects, clean-tech manufacturing and pilots.  
In the ‘general' decarbonisation large-scale topic (for projects with CAPEX above €100 million), there are 19 projects selected for grant, receiving a total of €2.28 billion. They include two projects from refineries, three projects from cement & lime, three from hydrogen, one from each of the following sectors (iron and steel, aviation and road transport), four from chemicals, and the remaining four from the ‘other' category, related to Industrial Carbon Management. These projects are located in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden. This topic showed the highest budget oversubscription with over 10 times the initial budget of €1.7 billion.
In the ‘general' decarbonisation medium-scale topic (for projects with CAPEX between €20 million and €100 million), there are 16 projects selected for grant, receiving a total of €461 million. They include four projects from the maritime sector, two from iron & steel, one from each of the following sectors (hydrogen, intra-day electricity storage, non-ferrous metals, refineries and solar energy), and four projects in ‘other' which are related to Industrial Carbon Management and biorefineries. They are located in Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.  
For the ‘general' decarbonisation small-scale topic (for projects with CAPEX between €2.5 million and €20 million), there are 8 projects selected for grant, together receiving €32 million. They include three projects from solar energy and one from each of the following sectors (chemicals, glass ceramics and construction materials, intra-day electricity storage and iron and steel), and a final project in the ‘other' category related to heat recovery. They are located in Belgium, Croatia, Italy and Spain.   
In the ‘cleantech manufacturing' topic (for projects with CAPEX above €2.5 million focusing on the manufacturing of components for renewable energy, energy storage, heat pumps and hydrogen production), there are 25 projects selected for grant, together receiving €1.6 billion. They include nine projects on electrolyser manufacturing, seven projects on batteries (including recycling and components) and nine projects on renewable energy components, including photovoltaic panels and wind turbines. They are located in Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain and Sweden. 
In the ‘pilots' topic (for projects with CAPEX above €2.5 million focusing on deep decarbonisation where the relative GHG emission avoidance should be a minimum of 75%), there are 17 projects preselected for grant, together receiving €440 million. They include five projects in the chemical sector, two in hydro/ocean energy, two projects in hydrogen, two projects on maritime, and one each from the following sectors (intra-day electricity storage, manufacturing of components for renewable energy storage, non-ferrous metals, other energy storage, wind energy), and a further project in the ‘other' category related to biomass. They are located in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Slovakia and Sweden.
For the first time, this call included specific provisions to support the decarbonisation of the maritime and aviation sector. There are six selected maritime projects focusing on electrification and sustainable fuel use, receiving a total of over €200 million, located in France, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway. In the aviation sector, one project has been selected. 
  2. How does the Innovation Fund's 2023 call contribute to EU policy objectives?  
The Innovation Fund uses revenues from the auctioning of allowances under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) to invest in Europe's green transition. This is at the heart of Europe's climate policies, driving down emissions in a fair and economically efficient way, and stimulating the transition to clean energy, technologies and industries.  In 2023, the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System Directive strengthened the Innovation Fund to lead the way in clean tech investments and set the example on a global stage to contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal by increasing its budget and introducing new auctioning tools. The Fund is one of the key tools of the European Green Deal Industrial Plan.
Clean manufacturing: 
The Innovation Fund supports the REPowerEU Plan to phase out Europe's dependency on Russian fossil fuels and is fully aligned with the priorities of the Net-Zero Industry Act, providing funding for a low- and net-zero-carbon economy, helping to bridge the cost gap between conventional and clean energy industries and accelerating the demonstration and deployment of innovative low-carbon solutions in Europe. 
The ‘Cleantech Manufacturing' category under the Innovation Fund 2023 call targets manufacturing components for renewable energy, energy storage, heat pumps and hydrogen production. With a total budget of €1.6 billion, 25 projects will develop, build and operate manufacturing plants for key components in wind and solar energy and for heat pumps, as well as components for electrolysers, fuel cells, energy storage technologies and the batteries value chain (including anchoring of key parts of the value chain in Europe such as cathode and anode active materials production).  
The Innovation Fund is also contributing towards the NZIA target of reaching 50 million tonnes per year of operational CO2 storage injection capacity by 2030. This will facilitate the capture and injection of CO2 from diverse hard-to-abate sources in energy-intensive industries, such as cement and lime, (bio)-refineries, chemicals and waste-to-energy. Projects selected in this call will capture CO2 and contribute 13% of the NZIA target. This call not only emphasises the importance of CO2 storage sites, which is a slower-developing aspect of the value chain but will support the development of four new CO2 storage projects and two projects developing CO2 storage as an integral part of their scope.  
Projects selected in this call and in previous calls will contribute to 9.8 GW of solar photovoltaic (PV) manufacturing capacity in the EU (3 GW from this call) and 12.2 GW of electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the EU (9.3 GW from this call).  
Energy intensive industries: 
The energy intensive industries will also be supported by a variety of climate mitigation technologies with a total of 40 projects in this call and 117 projects in total in all sectors covered by the ETS covering various indispensable innovations: integration of renewable energy, heat and energy storage solutions, recycling/reuse as well as electrification.  
Renewable hydrogen:  
The Innovation Fund is fully in line with the Renewable Energy Directive's targets to increase renewable energy sources across Europe. The Fund plays a substantial role in supporting the uptake of RFNBO (renewable fuel of non-biological origin) hydrogen in hard to abate applications in industry and transport. In total, projects selected in this and previous calls will contribute to the yearly production of 631.5 kilotonnes of RFNBO hydrogen. The projects selected in this call alone will deliver 61 kilotonnes annually.  
Net-Zero mobility:  
This call made an important contribution to emission reductions in the mobility sector with the maritime sector benefiting the most. As a result, six projects were selected out of 18 maritime applications received. The technologies cover building and retrofitting vessels for use of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) and electricity. For instance, one project will design and start serial production of a 19-seater hybrid electric aircraft and two other projects will reduce emissions in manufacturing of components for road transport. This is in addition to the important support for sustainable fuels for transport. Selected projects will support the production of a total of 525 kilotonnes per year of renewable fuels. 
  3. Is there a pre-allocation of funding per Member State or other measures that aim to achieve geographical balance?   
The Innovation Fund allocates its resources through competitive calls for proposals, applying the main award criteria described in the recently adopted Delegated Regulation for the operation of the Fund, the Financing Decision and previous call texts. These criteria are the greenhouse gas emission avoidance potential, degree of innovation, operational, financial, and technical maturity, replicability and cost efficiency. Projects are selected based on the highest scores across all five award criteria. Those that score the highest in the evaluation process in each category are selected within the available budget, irrespective of the sector or location. 
The legal basis of the Innovation Fund provides for the possibility to use a specific award criterion to ensure geographical balance. However, as Innovation Fund-supported projects are now located in 26 countries, and since the overall balance is improving with each call, the Commission did not believe it necessary to resort to this specific criterion. This improved geographic spread is also the result of other measures taken to support applications from all eligible Member States, such as supporting National Info Days and reinforcing the application helpdesk, as well as the option for small-scale projects to define innovation based on the state of the art at national level, and not at European level.  
To stimulate this broader geographical balance, there are already several initiatives in place to support Member States in their efforts to develop a high-quality national innovative project pipeline:    
Following the revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Directive dedicated Technical Assistance is provided for Member States with low effective participation, aiming to increase the overall quality of the Innovation Fund applications. This assistance was contracted in 2024 and Member States will start benefitting as of the beginning of 2025. 
Training sessions for all Member States National Contact Points and the Innovation Fund Expert Group representatives on award criteria, outreach and communication.  
Support from the Commission's Technical Support Instrument (TSI).

May_13_2024,"Questions and Answers: Revised CO2 emission standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles
1. How will the new EU legislation increase the number of zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles in Europe?
Heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) are responsible for more than 25% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from road transport in the EU and account for over 6% of the total EU GHG emissions.
The revised CO2 emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles will be key to drive down emissions in the road transport sector and ensure the increasing supply of new zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to the market. This is vital for the EU to shift to zero-emissions mobility and reach its 2030 climate goals and become climate neutral by 2050.
By setting ambitious CO2 emissions reduction targets for HDVs, the EU is providing a clear and long-term signal to guide investments in innovative zero-emission technologies and boost the rollout of recharging and refuelling infrastructure.
Zero-emission vehicles will become cheaper over time. The clear signal that the standards give to the automotive industry will therefore accelerate the market uptake of ZEVs. The associated economies of scale will further bring down vehicles' upfront costs, making them more affordable and attractive for potential buyers.
Together with the CO2 emission standards for HDVs, enabling policies play a major role in the uptake of zero-emission vehicles: infrastructure will be boosted thanks to the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation, which ensures enough publicly accessible electric recharging and hydrogen refuelling stations, and the Renewable Energy Directive making sure that we have a clean electricity grid to power these vehicles.
  2. What are the benefits for citizens and the industry?
Zero-emission and more energy-efficient vehicles will have clear benefits for air quality and the health of Europeans, and hence contribute to the Zero Pollution Action Plan. The reduction of air pollution directly translates into health benefits and the wellbeing of citizens, since the scope of application of the CO2 emission standards for HDVs also covers smaller trucks and buses, which are mostly driven in urban areas.
Transport operators and users will see significant cost savings. The total cost of ownership for first users of a new heavy-duty vehicle will reduce significantly: with savings on average of around €9,000 for a vehicle purchased in 2030 and €41,000 for a vehicle purchased in 2040. In addition, industrial development is changing the heavy-duty vehicle sector rapidly. EU HDV manufacturers are currently world-leading. By putting in place this legislation, EU industry and investors will know where to invest in innovative zero-emission technologies and the roll-out of recharging and refuelling infrastructure. This clear and common legal framework will be key to maintaining the EU's technological leadership in the future and supporting the employment of highly-skilled workers.
Moreover, with these new CO2 standards, the demand for fossil fuels is expected to decrease by around 2 billion barrels of oil over the period 2031 to 2050, contributing to the EU's energy independence.
  3. What is the scope of the new EU legislation?
The new legislation expands the current scope to cover almost all trucks (including vocational vehicles, such as garbage lorries, tippers or concrete mixers as of 2035), urban buses and long-distance buses (above 7.5 tonnes) as well as trailers (an unpowered vehicle towed by a motor vehicle). In 2027, the Commission will review the expansion of the scope also to small lorries.
Under the new regulation, ambitious targets are set to reduce CO2 emissions compared to 2019 levels by: 45% from 1 January 2030; 65% from 1 January 2035; 90% from 1 January 2040 onwards. In addition 90% of new urban buses in the EU will have to be zero-emissions as of 2030, and all of them by 2035.
As of 2030, specific emissions reduction targets will be in place for trailers (7.5%) and semi-trailers (10%) compared to 2025 levels.
It will be for manufacturers to decide which technologies they use to achieve these targets (e.g. electrification, hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen in internal combustion vehicles) as the new legislation is technology-neutral.
  4. What role will renewable and low-carbon fuels play in the future for heavy-duty vehicles?
To reach climate neutrality, renewable transport fuels need to become more widely available in the EU, and this should be incentivised in an appropriate manner. As a priority, these fuels must be made available in sufficient amounts for those hard-to-abate sectors where alternative decarbonisation options are not currently available, such as aviation and maritime, as well as for the existing stock of vehicles, including heavy-duty vehicles, given their long lifespan.
In 2027, the Commission will review the effectiveness and impact of the regulation. The Commission will assess a possible methodology for registering heavy-duty vehicles running exclusively on CO2 neutral fuels, in conformity with EU law and climate neutrality objectives, a methodology for the determination of full lifecycle CO2 emissions of new heavy-duty vehicles, the role of sustainable renewable fuels in the transition to climate neutrality, and the role of a carbon correction factor.
  5. What will be the impact on employment of this transformation of the automotive sector?
Stronger CO2 emission standards are projected to bring net positive impacts on economy-wide employment. The automotive value chain will expand and new quality jobs, for instance in battery production, electronics and in the energy sector, will be created. This will require future employees to have new and upgraded skills. At the same time, due to the reduced production of internal combustion engine vehicles and their specific components, some job losses will be experienced. Some sectors will shrink while others will expand.
Automotive suppliers and manufacturers may have to adapt their portfolio of products and services and reskill and upskill their employees accordingly to secure a workforce fit for the zero-emission mobility era. This is the third pillar of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, and supporting skills development, training and education is a shared challenge and opportunity. EU financing tools will support the transition. In addition to the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), the European Social Fund + (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) will contribute.
This is coupled with initiatives like the Clean transition dialogues, whose core aim is to support industry in building a business model fit for a decarbonised economy, and give input for building blocks that can contribute to a reinforced industrial approach to deliver on the European Green Deal. A dedicated Clean Transition Dialogue on Transport and Mobility took place on 8 April 2024. The Commission will continue its engagement with industry and social partners, and it stands ready to engage in a thorough debate with EU leaders and co-legislators on the key factors that need to be addressed, and to work together on these with all stakeholders.
  6. What are the exemptions introduced under the new EU legislation?
The introduction of new technologies is more expensive for small volume manufacturers than for larger ones, since they can take less advantage of economies of scale due to their lower production volumes. Therefore, small volume manufacturers registering up to 100 vehicles are exempt from meeting regulatory requirements. The environmental and climate impact of such an exemption will be very limited, so the core policy objectives are not harmed.
In addition, an exemption to the CO2 reduction targets will apply to the following heavy-duty vehicles:
vehicles used for mining, forestry and agricultural purposes
vehicles designed, constructed or registered for the use by armed services and track-laying vehicles
vehicles designed and constructed or adapted for use by civil protection, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order, or urgent medical care
vehicles registered for use by armed services
vehicles which cannot have their CO2 emissions certified for technical reasons, such as special purpose vehicles (for instance such as armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, and exceptional load transport vehicles), some heavy lorries with particular axle configurations, smaller lorries up to 5 tonnes and buses up to 7.5 tonnes
vocational vehicles, such as garbage trucks, until 2034.

Apr_30_2024,"Commission and national consumer protection authorities starts action against 20 airlines for misleading greenwashing practices
Following an alert from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), the European Commission and EU consumer authorities (Network of Consumer Protection Cooperation - CPC - Authorities) sent letters to 20 airlines identifying several types of potentially misleading green claims and inviting them to bring their practices in line with EU consumer law within 30 days.
The CPC network, led by the Belgian Directorate General for Economic Inspection, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets, the Norwegian Consumer Authority and the Spanish Directorate General of Consumer Affairs, focused on claims made by airlines that the CO2 emissions caused by a flight could be offset by climate projects or through the use of sustainable fuels, to which the consumers could contribute by paying additional fees. The authorities are concerned that the identified practices can be considered as misleading actions/omissions, prohibited under Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. On their part, the airlines are yet to clarify whether such claims can be substantiated based on sound scientific evidence.
Key elements of the action:
The European Commission and the CPC network, have identified several types of potentially misleading practices by 20 airlines, such as:
creating the incorrect impression that paying an additional fee to finance climate projects with less environmental impact or to support the use of alternative aviation fuels can reduce or fully counterbalance the CO2 emissions;
using the term “sustainable aviation fuels” (SAF) without clearly justifying the environmental impact of such fuels;
using the terms “green”, “sustainable” or “responsible” in an absolute way or use other implicit green claims;
claiming that the airline is moving towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) or any future environmental performance, without clear and verifiable commitments, targets and an independent monitoring system;
presenting consumers with a “calculator” for the CO2 emissions of a specific flight, without providing sufficient scientific proof on whether such calculation is reliable and without the information on the elements used for such calculation;
presenting consumers with a comparison of flights regarding their CO2 emissions, without providing sufficient and accurate information on the elements the comparison is based on.
Next steps
The European Commission and CPC authorities invited the companies to provide a response within 30 days, outlining their proposed measures to address the concerns arising from their environmental marketing claims under EU consumer law. After receiving replies from the companies, the European Commission will organise meetings with the CPC network and the airlines, to discuss the solutions proposed by the companies. Furthermore, the Commission will monitor the implementation of the agreed-upon changes. If the airlines involved do not take the necessary steps to solve concerns raised in the letter, CPC authorities can decide to take further enforcement actions, including sanctions.
This action aims to ensure alignment of the commercial practices across the air travel sector with EU consumer legislation, by establishing the necessary substantiation and of communication of voluntary environmental claims.
Background
The Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) is a network of authorities responsible for the enforcement of EU consumer protection laws. Under the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation, and with the coordination of the European Commission, they can take action to address cross-border issues at EU level. Moreover, within the same framework, consumer associations such as BEUC can post alerts about emerging market threats and their information is then directly accessible by enforcement authorities. The investigation was triggered by an alert of BEUC.
With the European Green Deal, the European Commission published in 2019 its strategic action plan to boost the use of more sustainable resources, by moving to a circular economy, to restore biodiversity and reduce pollution. Furthermore, with the New Consumer Agenda, the green transition has been set as a priority, together with the need to better equip consumers with clear and reliable information on the environmental impact of a product or a service. It also requires to better protect consumers against misleading climate-related claims, a practice often referred to as “greenwashing”.
Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Directive concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market prohibit unfair commercial practices in the form of misleading actions and omissions. The European Commission's Guidance Notice on the interpretation and application of the UCPD provides specific information about the environmental claims to be considered misleading.
A concrete step to enhance consumer protection against misleading green claims can also be found in the Directive on empowering consumers for the green transition, which explicitly bans claims, based on the offsetting of greenhouse gas emissions, that a product has a neutral, reduced or positive impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and it also defines the requirements to be respected by a trader while using claims on future environmental performance of a product.
Furthermore, the European Commission's Proposal for a Directive on substantiation and communication of explicit environmental claims (Green Claims Directive), proposed by the Commission in March 2023, provides that Member States shall ensure that traders carry out an assessment to substantiate explicit environmental claims. As regards offsetting claims in particular, traders should be transparent about what part of that claim concerns their own operations, and what part relies on buying offsets.

 Quote(s)
If we want responsible consumers, we need to provide them with accurate information. More and more travelers  care about their environmental footprint and choose products and services with better environmental performance. They deserve accurate and scientific answers, not vague or falseclaims. The Commission is fully committed to empowering consumers in the green transition and fighting greenwashing. We expect airlines, as well as any other industry operator, to make a responsible use of environmental claims.

Apr_12_2024,"Questions and Answers on the revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD)
1. What are the core elements of the revised EPBD?
The revised Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) puts Europe on track to achieve a fully decarbonised building stock by 2050 by spurring renovations in each Member State, particularly for worst-performing buildings. It upgrades the existing regulatory framework (agreed in 2018) to reflect higher climate ambition coupled with social action and provides the Member States with the flexibility needed to take into account the differences in the building stock across Europe. It does not impose any renovation obligation on individual homeowners.
Under the strengthened framework, residential and non-residential buildings are addressed differently. As regards residential buildings, each Member State will adopt its own national trajectory to reduce their average primary energy use by 16% by 2030 and 20-22% by 2035. The national measures will have to ensure that at least 55% of the decrease of the average primary energy use is achieved through the renovation of the worst-performing buildings, but Member States are free to choose which buildings to target and which measures to take.
As regards non-residential buildings, the revised Directive foresees the gradual introduction of Minimum Energy Performance Standards to renovate the 16% worst-performing buildings by 2030 and the 26% worst-performing buildings by 2033.Member States will have the possibility to exempt certain categories of both residential and non-residential buildings from these obligations, including historical buildings or holiday homes.
The revised Directive makes zero-emission buildings the new standard for new buildings. All new residential and non-residential buildings must have zero on-site emissions from fossil fuels, as of 1 January 2028 for publicly-owned buildings and as of 1 January 2030 for all other new buildings, with a possibility for specific exemptions.
The updated EPBD also strengthens the enabling framework for renovations. It introduces ‘Building Renovation Passport' schemes throughout the EU to help building owners plan their (staged) renovations.
Safeguards for tenants are also strengthened as Member States will have to introduce measures to tackle the risks of so-called ‘renovictions' (de-facto eviction related to a significant increase in rent following renovation works). Furthermore, the provisions on databases and data exchange will ensure the provision of reliable building information data to citizens and to financial institutions, to support renovations.
Better planning is also a key feature of the revised Directive. Under the new provisions, Member States will establish national Building Renovation Plans to set out the national strategy to decarbonise the building stock and how to address remaining barriers, such as financing, training and attracting more skilled workers. A common template with mandatory and voluntary elements is introduced to improve comparability across the Member States. Draft plans are to be submitted to the Commission for assessment and based on this assessment the Commission may issue recommendations that should further support the Member States in the elaboration of their final plans. The plans shall be submitted as part of the integrated National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs) process. Exceptionally this time, and considering the urgency to scale up building renovation based on solid national plans, the first draft of the plans shall be submitted by December 2025.
  2. How will the EPBD support the phase-out of fossil fuels used for heating in buildings?
To ensure a decarbonisation of the buildings sector, the EU Climate Target Plan highlights the need to phase out fossil fuels in heating by 2040. By then, the direct emissions of the buildings sector will have to have decreased by about 80%-89%. The revised EPBD will help the EU to phase-out, in a gradual manner, boilers powered by fossil fuels.  
The lifetime of heating systems is on average about 20 years. Under the revised EPBD, stand-alone boilers powered by fossil fuels will not be eligible for public support as of 2025, in line with the recommendations in the REPowerEU Plan and EU Save Energy Communication. While the revised EPBD does not mandate an EU-level phase-out date for installing new fossil fuel boilers, it introduces a clear legal basis for national bans, allowing Member States to set requirements for heat generators based on greenhouse gas emissions, the type of fuel used, or a minimum part of renewable energy used for heating. Many Member States consider such measures essential to achieve a decarbonised building stock and to improve air quality and health.
In addition, Member States will have to set out in their Building Renovation Plans their policies and measures with regard to the phase out of fossil fuels in heating and cooling with a view to a phase-out of fossil fuel boilers by 2040. 
Finally, to encourage the swift deployment of heating systems with zero direct emissions, the new zero-emission buildings must not cause any on-site carbon emissions from fossil fuels.
  3. How does the EBPD contribute to the increase of renewable energy in buildings?
On top of supporting the phaseout of fossil fuels from heating in buildings, the revised Directive introduces a specific requirement for all new buildings to be “solar ready”, meaning that they have to be fit to host rooftop photovoltaic or solar thermal installations at a later stage without costly structural interventions.
Member States should also ensure the deployment of suitable solar installations on large existing public buildings and existing non-residential buildings going through major renovations or for which a permit is required, as well as on new roofed car parks.
Furthermore, in zero-emission buildings (i.e. all new buildings from 2030), where technically and economically feasible, 100% of the total annual primary energy use will have to be covered by renewable energy generated onsite, nearby or from a renewable energy community, energy from an efficient district heating and cooling system or energy from carbon free sources.
The integration of renewables is also better highlighted in the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) as well as in the Building Renovation Passports.
  4. How does the revision of the EPBD support the deployment of electric vehicles and bicycle use?
The rollout of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles needs to be accelerated to accompany the expected increase of the electric vehicle fleet on EU roads. The Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) sets targets for the publicly accessible recharging infrastructure. Since it is expected that a large share of recharging will take place in buildings, the revised EPBD complements AFIR with requirements for recharging infrastructure and pre-cabling in buildings and adjacent carparks, both at home or at the workplace.
The revised Directive further requires Member States to simplify, streamline and accelerate the procedure for the installation of recharging points, and remove barriers to the installation of recharging points in multi-apartment buildings. There is also a new requirement for recharging points to support smart charging and where appropriate bi-directional charging, which is also in line with the Renewable Energy Directive. With smart charging, cars can be charged when energy prices are low or when renewable energy is abundant. As the technology evolves, it will also be possible to feed electricity back to the grid and use the car battery as a storage facility. Smart charging facilitates the integration of renewable energy such as wind and solar to the grid and helps decarbonise the energy system. Finally, the revised Directive addresses another important barrier to sustainable mobility - the lack of safe bicycle parking - by introducing requirements for bicycle parking spaces in new and renovated buildings and in existing large non-residential buildings. 
  5. What are Minimum Energy Performance Standards and to which buildings will they apply?
In general, Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) are requirements for existing buildings to meet a certain energy performance as part of a wide renovation plan for a building stock or at a trigger point on the market (such as sale, rent, donation or change of purpose within the cadastre or land registry), over a period of time or by a specific date, thereby triggering the renovation of existing buildings. They are already in use in some Member States. 
The revised EPBD establishes the gradual introduction of Minimum Energy Performance Standards only for non-residential buildings, to trigger the renovation of the very worst-performing buildings. Those standards will be based on maximum energy performance thresholds and lead to the renovation of the 16% worst-performing non-residential buildings by 2030 and the 26% worst-performing non-residential buildings by 2033. Member States will have flexibility to exempt several categories of buildings, based on an unfavourable cost-benefit assessment or because of the building category and how the building is used, such as for historical and heritage buildings. Member States are also required to establish a pathway to comply with lower maximum energy performance thresholds by 2040 and 2050 as part of their National Building Renovation Plans. 
For residential buildings, minimum energy performance standards will remain an optional tool to achieve the necessary energy performance improvement of the building stock. Member States will adopt a national trajectory to reduce the average primary energy use of the residential building stock at least by 16% by 2030 and 20-22%% by 2035 with high flexibility for them to decide which measures to apply and to which buildings. Still, the worst-performing buildings, defined as the 43% of the building stock with the lowest energy performance, will have to be renovated as a priority. For residential buildings, Member States will have to ensure that at least 55 % of the energy performance improvements are achieved, through the renovation of worst-performing residential buildings, for which usually renovations are most cost-efficient.
  6. How does the revised EPBD strengthen transparency on the energy performance of buildings? 
Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are an essential tool for assessing the performance of our buildings. The revision includes measures to make EPCs clearer, more reliable and visible, and to base them on a common template across all 27 EU Member States with a number of indicators on energy and GHG emissions, and voluntary ones on charging points or the presence of fixed controls for indoor air quality. This will benefit building owners, buyers and tenants, financial institutions and public authorities.
Control mechanisms and visibility in property advertisement are improved, and Member States have to publicly report on the quality assurance process for EPCs.
Under the revised EPC, there will be a common A-G scale. The ‘A' rating will correspond to zero-emission buildings while the ‘G' rating corresponds to the very worst-performing buildings in each country, with the remaining buildings in the country distributed among the classes in between. This will allow a clearer and simpler system of classification of buildings, facilitating access to financing, while being flexible and adaptable to the national characteristics of the building stock. Member States will also have the possibility to define an ‘A+' energy performance class corresponding to buildings which have an even better energy performance than zero-emission buildings and generate more renewable energy on-site annually than the amount of energy they consume.
EPCs will have to be issued and shown at more trigger points than today, including in case of major renovations and the renewal of a rental contract, to raise the awareness of building owners and tenants.
The recast EPBD also includes common requirements to have national databases on the energy performance of buildings, on access to those databases and publication of aggregated information. This will improve the availability of information, its quality and facilitate the work of public authorities and financial institutions, to spearhead renovations across Europe. 
Building renovation passport schemes will also be introduced across all Member States to provide reliable and personalised renovation roadmaps to building owners planning a staged renovation of their building.
  7. Will there be enough funding for energy renovations? 
Energy renovations of buildings pay for themselves over time, by generating savings on energy bills. However, there are a variety of obstacles at present which may deter home-owners from going ahead with energy renovations, leaving home-owners and tenants exposed to high energy bills and more vulnerable to energy price increases. This is especially true for those living in the worst-performing buildings, who are also often those with less capital to finance energy performance improvements.
The revised Directive will thus ensure that higher support is given to vulnerable households and greater emphasis is put on buildings for which renovations are the most cost-effective - and thereby bring the greatest savings. A very worst-performing building can consume up to 10-15 times more energy than a zero-emission building.
National Building Renovation Plans must enable the deployment of sufficient national-level finance and help leverage private investment at scale. Member States are required to include an overview of national policies and measures empowering and protecting vulnerable households, alleviating energy poverty and ensuring housing affordability, in line also with the recently published Commission Recommendations to tackle Energy Poverty.
With more than €100 billion estimated to be available from EU financing to support renovations between 2023 and 2030, the Commission is also helping to mobilise more financing necessary to cover upfront investment costs. EU financing comes from several sources including, the Cohesion Policy Funds, InvestEU, lending from the European Investment Bank, the LIFE Clean Energy Transition subprogramme, Horizon Europe including the Built for People Partnership, the ELENA Facility, the Modernisation Fund and the Recovery & Resilience Facility, thanks in particular to the strong ‘Renovate' flagships and dedicated REPowerEU-related chapters in national Recovery and Resilience Plans. Crucially,the new Social Climate Fund established under the European Green Deal will mobilise €86.7 billion for the period 2026-2032 to support vulnerable households and micro-enterprises, with energy renovations as one of the two focus areas (with transportation) on structural measures.
To enable an efficient combination of public and private financing, the Commission has also made the State aid framework more conducive to the needs of the EU-wide minimum energy performance standards, in particular the General Block Exemptions Regulation.
The revision should also contribute to mobilising support from financial institutions. The Directive tasks the Commission with developing a comprehensive portfolio framework for voluntary use by financial institutions, in view of supporting an increase in lending volumes for building renovation. Facilitated and regulated access by financial institutions to the EPC data should also facilitate the funding of renovations through private financial institutions.
  8. How does the revision of the EPBD address greenhouse gas emissions over the whole lifecycle?
Emissions from the manufacturing of materials, transportation, construction, maintenance and deconstruction of a building are known as “embodied carbon”. Carbon emissions linked to the use phase of the building are “operational” carbon emissions. Making good choices about efficient building practices and materials can have a huge effect on both operational and embodied carbon emissions.
The new rules take several positive steps towards addressing greenhouse gas emissions over the whole lifecycle of the buildings. Indeed, lifecycle GHG emissions will need to be calculated and disclosed through an EPC for all new buildings from 2030, to inform citizens and businesses. In addition, Member States will have to adopt national roadmaps and set targets to reduce such lifecycle emissions.
  9. How will the revision of the EPBD support better indoor air quality and indoor environmental quality?
Member States will retain the competence for regulating indoor environmental quality, and they will need to define the indoor conditions to be maintained in buildings in order to ensure healthy conditions. The revised EPBD supports high indoor environmental standards by requiring that new non-residential zero-emission buildings are equipped with measuring and control devices for monitoring and regulating indoor air quality. This is also the case for buildings undergoing major renovations, where technically and economically feasible.
These devices will monitor and regulate the operation of the building's technical building systems in order to ensure that they operate optimally and provide the required indoor environmental quality conditions, while maintaining high efficiency levels.
The Energy Performance Certificates and Smart Readiness Indicator will provide visibility to the buildings that have control and monitoring systems for indoor environmental quality installed.

Apr_5_2024,"Commission approves €350 million German State aid scheme to support renewable hydrogen production
The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €350 million German scheme to support the production of renewable hydrogen through the European Hydrogen Bank's “Auctions-as-a-Service” tool. The German measure is in line notably with the objectives of the REPowerEU Plan and the European Green Deal Industrial Plan. It will contribute to further reducing imports of Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition.
The German scheme
Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a €350 million scheme to support the production of renewable hydrogen through the “Auctions-as-a-Service” tool within the European Hydrogen Bank. The approved scheme will support the construction of up to 90 MW of electrolysis capacity and is expected to incentivise the production of up to 75,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen. This will help Germany achieve its ambition to have at least 10 GW of domestic electrolysis capacity by 2030 and contribute to the EU target of a minimum of 42.5% renewable energy production by 2030, with the aim of reaching 45%.
The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process supervised by the European Climate, Infrastructure, and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). The bidding closed on 8 February and the Agency is currently assessing and ranking bids for projects in all Member States. The support provided under this German scheme is will be open to companies planning to construct new electrolysers in Germany.
Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of a direct grant per kilogram of renewable hydrogen produced. The aid will be granted for a maximum duration of ten years. Beneficiaries will have to prove compliance with EU criteria for the production of renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). This includes contributing to the deployment or financing of the additional renewable electricity which is needed to produce the hydrogen supported under the scheme.
The Commission's assessment
The Commission assessed the measure under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities under certain conditions, and the 2022 Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG').
In particular, the Commission found that:
The scheme is necessary and appropriate to facilitate the production of renewable hydrogen and thus the decarbonisation of the industrial, transport and/or energy sectors.
The measure has an incentive effect, as the beneficiaries would not carry out the relevant investments without the public support.
Germany put in place sufficient safeguards to ensure that the scheme has a limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. In particular, the beneficiaries will be selected following an open, transparent and non-discriminatory bidding process and the aid will be kept to the minimum necessary to undertake the projects.
The aid will bring about positive effects, in particular on the environment, in line with the European Green Deal, that outweigh any possible negative effects in terms of distortions to competition.
On this basis, the Commission approved the German scheme under EU State aid rules.
Background
The Commission's 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help Member States provide the necessary support to reach the Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner.
The European Hydrogen Bank is an initiative to facilitate EU-domestic production and imports of renewable hydrogen in and to Europe. Its objective is to close the investment gap and connect the future renewable hydrogen supply to consumers to meet the intended target of 20 million tonnes by 2030, contributing to the REPowerEU objectives and the transition to climate neutrality. The Innovation Fund hydrogen auctions implement the EU-domestic leg of the European Hydrogen Bank.
On 20 December 2023, the Commission and Germany announced Germany's participation as first Member State in the European Hydrogen Bank “Auctions-as-a-Service” scheme.
Under the concept of Auctions-as-a-Service, Member States may choose to use the EU-wide pilot auction mechanism under the Innovation Fund to also allocate a pre-defined amount of national funding to renewable hydrogen production projects on their territory. These projects will be assessed and ranked in the competitive auction procedure under the auction and can become eligible for national funding if the Innovation Fund budget is insufficient to cover those projects. Auctions-as-a-Service are aimed at harmonising, and tying together national and European support schemes, increasing the comparability of subsidy levels, and saving on the administrative costs to Member States and project developers of developing and understanding different hydrogen support schemes.
The Renewable Energy Directive of 2018 set out stringent criteria for RFNBOs, such as renewable hydrogen, to ensure that their environmental impact is minimal and that they contribute to the deployment of renewable energy. Amongst others, emission savings of the end product must be at least 70% across the entire value chain. Amendments to the Renewable Energy Directive in 2023 increased the target for the share of renewable energy in the EU's gross energy consumption to 42.5% by 2030, and introduced a target that 42% of the hydrogen used in industry should be renewable by 2030, increasing to 60% by 2035.
With the European Green Deal Communication in 2019, the Commission set an objective of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 that is enshrined in the European Climate Law. In force since July 2021, the law also introduced the intermediate target of reducing net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. Through the adoption of the ‘Fit for 55' legislative proposals, the EU has now in place legally binding climate targets covering all key sectors in the economy.
The non-confidential version of the decision will be made available under the case number SA.109550 in the State aid register on the Commission's Competition website once any confidentiality issues have been resolved. New publications of State aid decisions on the internet and in the Official Journal are listed in the Competition Weekly e-News.
